        Feldmans Advocacy Group (formerly ALM Feldmans Advocates Bureau) 
        was established in 2000 by three Moscow-based attorneys at law: 
        Elena Agranovskaya, Natalia Yatskevich, and Pavel Ivlev. Our clients
        included Boris Berezovsky and his family, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, 
        Leonid Nevzlin, Platon Lebedev, Group Menatep Ltd, and Yukos Oil Company,
        as well as other current or former senior figures of Menatep and Yukos.
        From 2001 to 2004, the firm was well-known in Russia as an external 
        counsel for Yukos. Due to this, in 2004-2005, Feldmans became a target
        of the Russian governments aggressive actions against Yukos and 
        its associates. In 2005, Feldmans had to close its offices in Moscow
        and has since been operated from outside of Russia.

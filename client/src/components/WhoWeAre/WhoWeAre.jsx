        <h2 className="second">
        Feldmans Advocacy Group (formerly ALM Feldmans Advocates Bureau) 
        was founded in 2000 by three attorneys at law based in Moscow, Russia:
         Elena Agranovskaya, Natalia Yatskevich, and Pavel Ivlev. 
         The organization is named after Grigoriy Feldman, a Soviet
          mathematician and economist who was persecuted by the Soviet
           government led by Joseph Stalin. It is because of this foundation
            that we are dedicated to the causes of democracy, human and 
            civil rights, and justice.

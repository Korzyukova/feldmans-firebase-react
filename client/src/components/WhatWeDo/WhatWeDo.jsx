          Feldmans Advocacy Group specialiazes in political and advocacy
          campaigns, offering expert advice in communications, digital strategy,
          and social media. Our team provides these services to candidates,
          campaigns, and organizations that align with our values and beliefs.
          We also provide expert advice for political and advocacy campaigns 
          and communication strategies when dealing with national and international 
          businesses and political leaders. Our team offers these services to individuals
          and organizations that share our values and beliefs.
          For the past quarter of a century, our primary duty, as both professionals in
          the field of law and human rights defenders, has been to study and analyze 
          the legal, political, social, and economic situation in Russia in order 
          to advise and guide clients from all around the world. </h2>
          <h2 className="second">Pavel Ivlev, our
          principal and owner, has participated as a panelist or speaker in dozens
          of conferences on Russia and Russia-related human rights issues, 
          including the persecution of dissidents and human rights leaders.
          His long, uninterrupted status as a Russian attorney and many years 
          of professional experience in practicing corporate, tax, and criminal
          law enable Pavel to provide an independent expert opinion on all
          aspects of Russias law in relation to specific politically motivated cases.
          His experience as a legal adviser to the largest Russian companies 
          and his further activities as a consultant to individuals and businesses 
          on corporate and tax law issues allow Pavel to properly understand and 
          assess the circumstances of a Russian criminal prosecution.
          In recent years, he has also acted as an expert witness in several 
          asylum and extradition cases before US, British, Spanish, and Italian 
          authorities, as well as represented numerous clients seeking the 
          removal of their names from the Interpol Information System.
